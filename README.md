# Coursera Developing Data Products course project.
----------------------------------------------------

This is Shiny app, created to complete course project.

It is a simple app where you specify normal distributions mean, its standard deviation, number of observations and how many times the specified distribution should be generated.

When you hit "Create the plots" button, the plots are generated:
- for distribution of one sample
- sampling distribution of the sum of observations
- sampling distribution of the means
- sampling distribution of the variance

You can run the app on the [shinyapps website](https://samseltomasz.shinyapps.io/Shiny_sample_app)
